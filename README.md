# bay-area-bike-share
The final project of Data Science I Fundamentals Udacity's Nanodegree, which consists of analyzing the data of Bay Area Bike Share.

Bay Area Bike Share is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees.


The project runs in Jupyter Notebook and some libraries are used:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
